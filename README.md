# StockVision
## 📌 Overview

The Stock Market Prediction App is a data-driven project that leverages machine learning and real-time financial data to predict stock prices and trends. It integrates APIs for fetching live stock market data and utilizes visualization tools to help users analyze stock performance.

## 🔍 Features

Live Stock Data Fetching: Integrated API to retrieve real-time stock market data.

Historical Data Analysis: Used past stock trends to derive insights.

Machine Learning Predictions: Applied ML models to predict future stock prices.

Data Visualization: Interactive charts for stock trend analysis.

Technical Indicators: Implemented key indicators like Moving Averages, RSI, MACD, etc.

User Input Support: Allows users to enter stock symbols and get predictions.

## 📊 Technologies Used

Python (for data analysis and ML modeling)

Pandas, NumPy (for data preprocessing)

Scikit-Learn (for machine learning models)

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly (for visualizations)

Streamlit (for an interactive web app)

Yahoo Finance API / Alpha Vantage API (for fetching real-time stock data)

Flask / FastAPI (optional backend for API handling)

## 📂 Dataset

The app retrieves historical stock data using APIs.

Preprocessed data includes date, open price, close price, high, low, volume, and technical indicators.

🚀 How to Run the Project

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-prediction-app.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd stock-prediction-app

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

streamlit run app.py

OR, if using Flask:

python app.py

## 📈 Insights Gained

Trend Analysis: Identified historical patterns that influence stock prices.

Prediction Accuracy: Evaluated different ML models like Linear Regression, LSTM, and ARIMA.

Impact of Market Events: Studied how news and financial events affect stock movements.

Volatility Measurement: Used historical data to assess market risks.

## 📜 Future Improvements

Implement deep learning models (LSTM, RNNs) for better time-series forecasting.

Add sentiment analysis based on financial news headlines.

Enhance the UI with real-time interactive dashboards.

Provide stock recommendations based on risk assessment and trends.
